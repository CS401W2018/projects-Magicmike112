    1. Movie:
   <p>My favorite movie of all time is the wolf of wall street. it is arguably the most non church appropriate move of all time. However its a cinematic masterpeice with the astonishing acting of the one and only Leonardo Dicaprio.</p> 
   <p>2. Tv show: my favorite TV show of all time is the sopranos and sons of anarchy. the sopranos is about the italian mafia of new jersey. sons of anarchy is about a biker gang in nor cal.</p>
    3. Favorite movie genre: <p>My overall favorite movie genre is drama, horror and action.The absoulte rush you get when watching horror and action movies is amazing<p>

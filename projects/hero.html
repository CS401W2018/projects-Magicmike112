From gripping dramas like "The Revenant" to thought-provoking roles in "Wolf of Wall Street" he consistently delivers powerful performances. Beyond acting, his commitment to environmental activism inspires me. He uses his platform to raise awareness about climate change, making him a true role model.</p>

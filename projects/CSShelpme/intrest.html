    1. Movie:

   <p class="deemphasize">show: my favorite TV show of all time is the sopranos and sons of anarchy. the sopranos is about the italian mafia of new jersey. sons of anarchy is about a biker gang in nor cal.</p>
    3. Favorite movie genre: favorite movie genre is drama, horror and action.The absoulte rush you get when watching horror and action movies is amazing

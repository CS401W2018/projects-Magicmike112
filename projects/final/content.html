                Welcome to Wally's Smokehouse! We are determined to provide high-quality smoked meat at affordable prices to all communities on Oahu. Founded in 2017 in Mililani, Hawaii, USA, by Walter Lee Henyan, Wally's Smokehouse began as a passion project. Walter discovered his love for smoking meat after purchasing a smoker on Craigslist. What started as a hobby soon blossomed into a beloved establishment, built on community, family, and affordability. We promise an experience that will leave you coming back for more.
                
                At Wally's Smokehouse, we pride ourselves on our commitment to using only the finest, locally sourced ingredients. Every cut of meat is slow-cooked to perfection, infusing it with rich, smoky flavors that will transport you to the heart of the islands. Whether you're a long-time customer or a first-time visitor, our welcoming atmosphere and flavorful dishes make every meal feel like home.
                
                From classic favorites like smoked brisket and ribs to unique island-inspired creations, we offer something for everyone. Join us for an unforgettable dining experience where passion, quality, and community come together. We look forward to serving you and making every visit a memorable one!</p>

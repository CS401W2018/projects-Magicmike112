     <p>1. What is the difference between a block and an inline tag</p>
     <p>Block tags: These elements take up the full width available and start on a new line.  div, h1, p, and ul.</p>
     <p>2. What is normal flow in HTML?</p>
     <p>Block elements like div and p stack vertically, starting on a new line.</p>
     <p>Inline elements like span and a sit next to each other horizontally.</p>
     <p>3. What does float do? Why do you need to clear the float?</p>
     <p>What it does: The float property allows elements to be positioned to the left or right of their container, letting text and inline elements wrap around them.</p>
     <p>Clearing the float: You need to clear floats to prevent parent containers from collapsing, ensuring proper layout. This can be done using the clear property or clearfix methods.</p>
     <p>4. What do absolute, fixed, and relative do?</p>
     <p>Absolute: Positions an element relative to its nearest positioned ancestor (not static). It can overlap other elements.</p>
     <p>Fixed: Positions an element relative to the viewport, so it stays in place when scrolling.</p>
     <p>Relative: Positions an element relative to its original position in the document flow, allowing for adjustments without changing other elements' layout.</p>
     <p>How can you make nice navigation buttons for mobile devices?</p>
     <p>Use CSS for styling (e.g., rounded corners, padding).</p>
     <p>Use flexbox for layout to make them responsive.</p>
     <p>Ensure touch targets are large enough for easy tapping.</p>
     <p>5. Where can you find videos to review what we talked about in class?</p>
     <p>You can find review videos on platforms like YouTube, educational sites like Khan Academy, or your class's learning management system (like Canvas or Blackboard) if they provide video resources.</p>

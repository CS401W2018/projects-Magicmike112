        <h1>What is the main difference between CSS Grid and CSS Flex?</h1>
        <p>CSS Grid is designed for two-dimensional layouts, allowing you to control both rows and columns simultaneously. It’s ideal for complex layouts with overlapping elements.</p>
        <p>CSS Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional layouts, focusing on either rows or columns. It’s great for distributing space along a single axis, making it useful for simpler layouts like navigation menus.</p>
